A high percentage of the homeslessness population are older adults and/or have pre-existing conditions. They have significant barriers to self-care and hygiene. Crowded conditions also ease the spread of airborne infections. Many of the recommendations to prevent COVID are difficult for the homeless to execute.\n\nHomeless shelters are grappling with COVID safety as winter approaches. The homeless population is increasing and has grown by 22% over the last five years. The great need for shelter supasses the limited system resources. To mitigate this effect, some cities have set up emergency shelters in unused public school buildings and hotels.",

    "description": "Referring to COVID-19 as the ‘China virus’, ‘Wuhan virus’, or the like, promotes othering and stigmatization. The increase in racist rhetoric coincides with increases in racial attacks, violent bullying, threats, racial abuse, and discrimination. It has exacerbated social stigma, national insecurity, and fear of foreigners. COVID-19 is a public health crisis not a racial matter. \n\nBy August 2020, the STOP AAPI HATE Reporting Center received over 2,500 reports of incidents of racism, hate speech, discrimination, and physical attacks against Asians and Asian Americans nationwide.
