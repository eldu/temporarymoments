On February 29, 2020, Gov. Jay Inslee declared a State of Emergency to slow the spread of COVID-19.   
  
Washington has had one of the lowest amounts of cases and deaths per 1 million people compared to the rest of America. As of November 15, 2020 there are over 130,000 confirmed cases and 2,500 deaths in Washington.

Mental illness has sharply increased in 2020 and has continued to rise over the last few years. People who screened with moderate to severe symptoms of anxiety or depression noted that they were struggling most with loneliness and isolation. Rates of anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideation rates are rising amongst adults and are the highest among youth.

May Day. The record high unemployment rates due to COVID, delays in unemployment payments, unclear eviction bans, and pending rent threaten food and shelter for many. Neighborhoods in Seattle petitioned a rent strike to put pressure on landlords and politicians for a statewide suspension of rent, mortgage, and utility payments.

Car traffic across the country has decreased ~40% during the pandemic as people work from home and unemployment rates skyrocket. However, some cities are seeing minimal decrease in air pollution where their dominant sources of pollution include factories, refineries, power plants, and diesel trucks. Efforts for cleaner air must continue.

Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone (CHAZ) was an occupational protest and self-declared autonomous zone in Capitol Hill. It encompassed six city blocks and Cal Anderson Park surrounding Seattle Police Department�s East Precinct building. It would later be known as the Capitol Hill Occupied Protest (CHOP).

_No good cops  
No bad protesters  
No Justice  
No peace  
You are now entering free capital hill_  
  
Prior to the zone�s formation, there were escalating tense interactions between protestors and the Seattle Police Department (SPD). SPD, in full riot gear, used aggressive dispersal tactics on protestors. They used blast balls, flash bangs, pepper spray, and tear gas to control the crowds. 

  

  

![1YZWn-A1bx9bcWntlE8gmPY_E8X1WC8oT](images/photos_thumbnail/1YZWn-A1bx9bcWntlE8gmPY_E8X1WC8oT.jpg)  

  

On the night of June 7th 2020, a man drove a car into the crowd and shot a protestor. He walked past the police barricade and toward the police. They didn't fire off any tear gas, flash bombs, or rubber bullets at him even though he just shot a civilian. The victim was treated by protestors until medics arrived.  
  
Later that night, SPD used tear gas to control the protestors despite the mayor�s ban just days prior. They tweeted that the crowd threw rocks, bottles, and fireworks. The next morning the police boarded up and moved out of the East Precinct in an effort to de-escalate the situation. Protesters moved into the zone to begin the occupational protest.

"You have the right to remain heard" is an ironic nod to the Miranda rights while not forgetting the excessive use of police force historically against Black Americans. During interactions wherein the victim posed little to no threat to police officers, Black Americans were three times more likely to be shot and killed by the police officers.

Defunding the police proposes to reduce and redistribute the police budget towards essential underfunded social services.   
  
"Police budgets continue to be consistent across diverse geographies and cities in the United States, with up to 20% to 45% of discretionary funds allocated to the violent system. All of the police budgets analyzed in the Freedom to Thrive Report have increased since FY17." [(Source: The Center for Popular Democracy)](https://populardemocracy.org/news-and-publications/congress-must-divest-billion-dollar-police-budget-and-invest-public-education)  
  
Crime reduction is difficult without addressing problems stemming from chronic poverty. Homeless shelters, workforce development programs, schools, hospitals, food pantries, and community centers have a significant impact on reducing crime rate and increasing safety. They provide support for people and services in marginalized communities.

In this ongoing series of police brutality protests, protestors have been charged with felonies and misdemeanors including violating curfew, trespassing, vandalism, property destruction, theft, and unlawful assembly. An arrest or minor charge can have significant consequences that ripple through a person�s life.  
  
These protestors should be celebrated for their courage and forgiven their civil disobedience--not prosecuted. In 2006, the Rosa Parks Act was passed to clear the arrest records from those considered law-breakers during the Montgomery bus boycott of civil disobedience charges. That boycott resulted in the Supreme Court ruling segregation on public buses unconstitutional. It was a significant step towards civil rights and transit equality.

"Fuck SPD", "Fuck 12" and "Fuck the Police" were spray painted all across the CHAZ/CHOP zone in response to the excessive use of force by SPD. "Fuck the Police" originates from "Fuck tha Police", a protest song by N.W.A in 1988, that protests police brutality and racial profiling.

"I swore an oath to defend our constitution against all enemies foreign and God damned domestic. Three generations of my family have served for this god damned county. Ever since we've been allowed to pick up arms someone in my family has fuckin' served... It's about God damn time America realized who the fuck I am... I'm motherfuckin' Black and I'm motherfuckin' proud." quote by Aubrey Rose, a proud Black retired army staff sergeant.

Stencil graffiti is an effective technique to quickly spray artwork up and replicate. These artworks are easy to understand because of its simple and straightforward designs. Street artists have used this technique to provide political commentary, protest, and to criticize our society.  
  
These BLM power fist salutes have been sprayed throughout the country on streets, walls, and other surfaces. It interrupts and challenges our everyday spaces. _This is not a moment, it�s a movement._

The killing of George Floyd by the Minneapolis police is part of a long line of incidents of excessive police misconduct with qualified immunity. Qualified immunity is a Supreme Court doctrine that shields government officials from liability for misconduct, even if rights are violated, unless there is a clearly established law from a prior case with the same consequences.  
  
Christopher J. Davis, was shot and killed by a Walworth County deputy who fired into a moving vehicle when deadly force was not appropriate or necessary. The U.S. 7th District Court of Appeals in Chicago decided that the deputy was covered under qualified immunity.

This is the memorial made for George Floyd and others who have died in subsequent protests for BLM. There are messages of love, of the change we wish to see, and of memories respecting those who have died. Candles were lit to show solidarity and celebrate the lives of those who have lost theirs.  
  
"Mourn for the dead and fight like hell for the living," is a quote by Mary Harris Jones, a female labor activist who helped establish the Industrial Workers of the World.

Eltana, a Montreal-style wood-fired bake cafe, was in the heart of CHOP. It is located at the intersection of 12th and Pine directly across the East Precinct of the Seattle Police Department.  
  
They supported CHOP as a step towards systemic change. In the morning, they�d bring out bagels to the No Cop Co-Op, a free food distribution station set up inside of CHOP. They gave half a dozen free bagels to customers if they donated $25+ to any racial justice organization or dined at a Black-owned restaurant in the city with a receipt. Anyone who walked in and said that they�re hungry for justice got a free bagel and spread.

The homeless are one of the most susceptible and vulnerable to the pandemic. A high percentage of the homeslessness population are older adults and/or have pre-existing conditions. They have significant barriers to self-care and hygiene. Crowded conditions also ease the spread of airborne infections. Many of the recommendations to prevent COVID are difficult for the homeless to execute.  
  
Homeless shelters are grappling with COVID safety as winter approaches. The homeless population is increasing and has grown by 22% over the last five years. The great need for shelter supasses the limited system resources. To mitigate this effect, some cities have set up emergency shelters in unused public school buildings and hotels.

Health care workers are experiencing rising levels of burnout, anxiety, and stress. The shortage of Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) puts their patients and themselves at risk. PPE is not intended to be reused. Delayed test turnarounds are preventing the US from effectively containing the virus through the strategy of testing, tracing, and isolating.

Referring to COVID-19 as the �China virus�, �Wuhan virus�, or the like, promotes othering and stigmatization. The increase in racist rhetoric coincides with increases in racial attacks, violent bullying, threats, racial abuse, and discrimination. It has exacerbated social stigma, national insecurity, and fear of foreigners. COVID-19 is a public health crisis not a racial matter.   
  
By August 2020, the STOP AAPI HATE Reporting Center received over 2,500 reports of incidents of racism, hate speech, discrimination, and physical attacks against Asians and Asian Americans nationwide. Read report releases [here](https://stopaapihate.org/reportsreleases/).
