## Instructions for Updating Photos
- Add photos to the Google Drive folder for temporary moments
- Run `python get_photos.py` with a credentials file. It creates a `photos.json` file.
- Build
  - `npm run build` or `bundle exec jekyll build`
- Test locally
  - `npm start` or `bundle exec jekyll serve`
- Deploy
  - `npm run deploy`

## Future Ideas
- Collaborate with more people and showcase more photos and stories
- Parallax scrolling to advance the slideshow with text on the side
- Map with timestamps of when these photos were taken. Explore the geography
- Use Github Actions to run getting photos
