Public art is an accessible form of communication that spans across social boundaries. It confronts people in their everyday environment. It is a reflection of the times we live in and is a critique on society.

Currently, this project focuses on the events that unfolded in Seattle, WA from the stay at home order through the racial justice protests in 2020. Murals painted across boarded up buildings express the raw emotions of the community. The Black Lives Matter movement and these protests are resonating with a lot of people. 

These are temporary moments that have happened. Lives have been affected. Letâ€™s talk about it. We encourage you to be curious and to widen your perspective.
